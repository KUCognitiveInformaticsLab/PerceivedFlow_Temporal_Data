# PerceivedFlow_Temporal_Data

The data from the "Temporal Dynamics of Perceived Motion Flow in Naturalistic Movie Sequences" is contained in this folder.

Dataset S1 (Raw response data). The motion vectors of raw response are supplied in Temporal_Response.mat 
\n The data matrices are 7D matrices of the following dimensions: 
2 (uv components) x 4 (probed locations) x 4 (flip conditions in image coornidates) x 2 (play directions) x 5 (probe timing) x 5 (movies) x 4 (participants).

Dataset S2 (Ground truth data). The motion vectors of ground truth are supplied in Temporal_GT.mat 
The data matrices are 6D matrices of the following dimensions: 
2 (uv components) x 4 (probed locations) x 2 (play directions) x 5 (probe timing) x 5 (movies) x 15 (frames).
Notes: 8th frame is the probed target frame

Dataset S3 (FlowNet 2.0). The predicted motion vectors of FlowNet 2.0 are supplied in Temporal_FN2.mat 
The data matrices are 6D matrices of the following dimensions: 
2 (uv components) x 4 (probed locations) x 2 (play directions) x 5 (probe timing) x 5 (movies) x 14 (frames).
Notes: 8th frame is the probed target frame


Dataset S4 (Fitting functions with all Observers). The predicted motion vectors of four fitting function with all observers are supplied in Temporal_AllObservers.mat 
The data matrices are 6D matrices of the following dimensions:
